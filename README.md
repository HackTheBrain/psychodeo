## Background
According to the affective model, arousal is one of the core dimensions of emotions that can be used as a measuring unit (Nolen-Hoeksema, Frederickson, Loftus, & Wagenaar, 2012). EEG can be used not only as a measuring tool, but also as a biofeedback to modulate it. For example children with ADHD have different cognitive arousal manifesting through more beta and theta waves in resting state on EEG (Alexander, H., D., & Linkenkaer-Hanse, 2012). Studies have reported the positive effect of EEG biofeedback in terms of normalizing the level of arousal, improveness of behavior, attention and even improved grades and achievement scores (Alhambra et al., 1995; Caromody et al., 2000; Drechsler et al., 2007; Gevensleben et al., 2010; Leins et al., 2007). On the other hand, people with insomnia usually have a higher arousal measured as more beta and gamma waves (Alexander et al., 2012). The aim of the project is to create an interactive neurofeedback that could help the person to learn to decrease the stimulated level of arousal and/or induce a relaxed state in the person after an exposition to short-term arousal.
## Hypotheses
The emotional stimuli will induce arousal which can be measured. Seeing ones face aging will work as an emotional stimuli. The proband then is instructed with a guided relaxation technique, which will decrease the arousal below the baseline. This can be used as a systematic EEG neurofeedback.
Alternatives
If aging does not work as an emotional stimuli facilitating emotional arousal to a certain degree, pictures according to International Affective Picture Systém (IAPS) will be used instead and the aging will work only as a feedback.
## Methods
We used camera to record the probands faces live. The probands were instructed to watch themselves without moving and without changing facial expressions. They were told that the research deals with self-perception. Than the face was shifted using the features from photos of old people extracted and transfered into probands faces. The arousal was measured with EEG algorhythm. When the arousal shifted, the probands were guided through a relaxation technique (still watching the stimuli):
Breathe deeply into your belly. Inhale and long exhale (repeats). Now imagine that all the tension from your body accumulates in your belly as a dark cloud. Now imagine that you have roots growing from your feet into the earth. Now take a deep inhale, and with the exhale, imagine sending the dark cloud down from your body to the earth. With the exhale, you are breathing in a very relaxed feeling that is spreading from your lungs into your whole body.
Alternative techniques were also prepared, such as creating a safe space visualisation.
When the lewel of arousal went under the baseline and crossed a certain treshold set by the experimentator, the face viewed on camera shifted back to its original look. This was a feedback for the proband that the relaxation was succesful.
